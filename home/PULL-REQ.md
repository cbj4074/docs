# Pull Requests

**Reviews**

*`Every`* PR should request *`at-least`* a review from `cbj4074` and/or `poppabear8883` 

**WIP**

Prefixing a PR with `WIP` means ***`don't merge`***, only review!
    
This workflow is useful for requesting reviews while you are in-progress of adding new features

Only once you are fully reviewed and all conversations have been resolved should you remove WIP from the title
   
**Merging**

The author of a PR ***`cannot`*** merge their own PR.

`This only applies to Core Developers, Contruibutors won't have this ability anyways.`
