# About

#### Why indieHD over iTunes, Amazon, CD Baby, Bandcamp, etc.?
 
**Fairness**
 
 * We give artists the money they deserve: ~85% of each dollar. We keep 10% to cover our costs, and 
 payment processing accounts for ~5% of the average order.
 
 * Customers are able to re-download purchased music any time they like, directly from any web 
 browser. indieHD music is DRM-free and no proprietary software is required to download or play the 
 files.

**Quality**

 * We offer lossless audio files, which contain the original, CD-quality data from the physical CD. 
 Most digital music stores offer the customer a low-fidelity file (such as MP3 or M4A). For 
 convenience, we also offer MP3 and M4A versions of each purchased track, as well as ALAC 
 (Apple Lossless Audio) and WAV.
 
 * 90-second track previews are available for all songs, and artists choose the particular section 
 of each song that is available for preview.
 
 * High-Resolution album artwork accompanies each album at the artist's option.
 
 * A print-quality CD-booklet ("liner notes"), in PDF format, accompanies each album at the artist's 
 option.

**Transparency**

 * We show both artists and fans how each sale is allocated (% to artist, % to credit card 
 processing, % to indieHD expenses).

**Light-Touch**

 * There are no long-term contracts to sign; artists enable/disable/manage their own music catalogs 
 and leave any time they like.
 
 * Artists set their own song prices.
 
 * Customers can purchase any number of songs from a given album; buying the entire album is not 
 required.


#### How does it work?
E-Commerce is expensive, and not every musician is in a position to set-up a secure web-server and 
sell music online. Instead, many do-it-yourself artists and music labels turn to an 
`"out-of-the-box"`solution. While less expensive than a custom e-commerce solution, these systems 
tend to be clunky and difficult to integrate with existing branding. Further, these systems are not 
designed specifically to sell digital music, and are often ill-equipped for the purpose; most 
platforms allow only for physical products to be sold, and those that offer digital downloads do 
so as an afterthought.

By contrast, the indieHD platform is designed specifically to sell digital music and downloadable 
DVDs. By taking a modest percentage of each sale, at 10%, we're able to pay for the entire 
operation: webserver/hosting, security certificate, bandwidth, customer care, maintenance, and 
future site development. This strategy avoids the need for all of us to have our own business 
entities, merchant accounts, payment gateway providers, etc., which would constitute an astronomical 
expense. Instead, we're all `"splitting the bill"` and running all transactions through a single 
gateway and merchant account. Using a billpay service, we're able to pay the artist directly and no 
second `"monetary transfer"` charge is applied; the money goes straight from our checking account 
into the artist's. `(Artists outside of the U.S. must receive funds through PayPal, which is the 
most cost-effective option for international payments.)`

The 10% that we keep also allows us provide customer care to fans who purchase your music, 
should they experience problems of any kind with their orders, and ensures that this website and 
your music remain online and available to your fans into the indefinite future.
