# Documentation

This documentation is broken-down into sections and some documentation may differ between 
repositories.

The first section `Getting Started` will cover all documentation that will be consistent across all repositories and 
will provide information about the overall project.

The `Web API` and `Website UI` sections will of course cover all documentation related to the
***web-api*** and ***website-ui*** repositories specifically.

To contribute to `this documentation` please refer to [The Docs Repository](../DOCSREPO.md)
