# The Mission
We provide Artists with a simple, do-if-yourself platform for selling their music to fans, 
digitally.

We have a passion for high-quality audio and album artwork, and we go to great lengths to preserve 
your work's fidelity.

Plenty of excellent streaming services exist, and we don't aim to compete with them. We serve an 
entirely different purpose: sometimes, your fans simply want to preview, pay, and download in CD-quality or better.

While streaming has its place, a music-loving contingent exists that demands pristine sound for 
playback over a high-definition system.

Fans who love our platform have a few basic wants:

* I want to buy the album
* I want to buy it now
* I want the full quality of the studio release. 
* I want to download the files to my device without needing iTunes or similar
* I want to playback the files on any device and without restriction.

We thrive on fairness, integrity, and transparency. There are no hidden algorithms or 
behind-the-scenes trickery, and every aspect of the platform aims to be maximally straightforward.
